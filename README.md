The package was created for several of my own projects, but one day I will write full instructions for its use to make it useful and convenient for everyone :)

Installation
```php
composer require karlos3098/laravel-primevue-table-service
```

Publish components for vue
```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Karlos3098\\LaravelPrimevueTableService\\Providers\\LaravelPrimevueTableServiceProvider"
```
